      <p>Hello and welcome to our bookstore.<br />
        This is not just a store — it’s a journey through reading, a space for thought, work, and critique.</p>

      <p>The store is designed for those who are passionate about politics, current affairs, history,
        dystopian literature, and other non-fiction works.</p>

      <p>We, the administrators of this store, invite you to explore a selection of books we chose specifically
        for readers like us.</p>

      <p>I’m <strong>Sagi Akshikar</strong>, the creator of this website, and I dedicate it to those who are just
        beginning their reading journey as well as to experienced readers looking for inspiration.</p>

      <p>Our goal is to make this site accessible to a wide audience who shares our love for books.</p>

      <p>Every book featured on this site is one I, Sagi Akshikar, have read and found worth sharing.
        The site links to online purchase options <strong>e-vrit.co.il</strong>, a well-known Israeli platform for buying books.</p>

      <p class="home-signature">Happy reading!</p>
