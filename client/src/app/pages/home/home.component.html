  <p class="home-paragraph">
    Hello and welcome to our bookstore. <br />
    This is not just a store — it’s a journey through reading, a space for thought, work, and critique.
  </p>

  <p class="home-paragraph">
    The store is designed for those who are passionate about politics, current affairs, history,
    dystopian literature, and other non-fiction works.
  </p>

  <p class="home-paragraph">
    We, the administrators of this store, invite you to explore a selection of books we chose specifically
    for readers like us.
  </p>

  <p class="home-paragraph">
    I’m <strong>Sagi Akshikar</strong>, the creator of this website, and I dedicate it to those who are just
    beginning their reading journey as well as to experienced readers looking for inspiration.
  </p>

  <p class="home-paragraph">
    Our goal is to make this site accessible to a wide audience who shares our love for books.
  </p>

  <p class="home-paragraph">
    Every book featured on this site is one I, Sagi Akshikar, have read and found worth sharing.
    The site links to online purchase options <strong>e-vrit.co.il</strong>, a well-known Israeli platform for buying books.
